# Artworks, Sets, and Projections

## An **Artwork** is a combination of the **Set** and the **Projection**

The **artwork** refers to the final outcome of a drawing ready to be exported. It can either be a section drawing, a plan or axon drawing of a street segment or an intersection. **Artworks** are categorized into three **Projections**: the **Section**, **Plan**, and the **Axon**.

Each **Artwork** is regarded as a representation, or "projection" of an imaginary street segment or intersection. That imaginary segment or intersection is called a **Set**. Each **Set** may be depicted using one of the three **Projections**.

The below table shows the combination of **Set** types and the three **Projections**. Together, they form

| **Set type** | **Section**      | **Plan**          | **Axon**          |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Intersection | *Not applicable* | Intersection Plan | Intersection Axon |
| Segment      | Street section   | Segment Plan      | Segment Axon      |
