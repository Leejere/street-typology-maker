# Street Typology Maker (work in progress)

This app is for planners and designers to make and customize street typology drawings (including sections, plans, and axons of street segments or intersections) by inputting parameters. While these types of drawings have clear patterns and are highly automizable, they are usually made manually whenever needed, resulting in large amounts of repetitive work. Existing web apps like Street Mix are limited, as they allow only section drawings and do not support the customization of styles nor multi-layer street typologies.
